Version 1.2.0 (2016-11-08):
---------------------------
  Additions

  - Compatibility with OCaml 4.04 (#113).
  - Install .mli files (#98, prompted Christian Lindig).

  Removals

  This release removes several features which appear to get little or no use.

  - Rename package bisect_ppx.plugin to bisect_ppx.ocamlbuild; bisect_ppx.plugin
    is still available as a deprecated name (#93).
  - Remove -combine-expr option from the reporter (#105, #106).
  - Remove EMMA, XML, and "bisect" output formats (#105, #106).
  - Remove obsolete -no-navbar and -no-folding options from HTML output (#106).
  - Remove point kinds (#101).
  - Eliminate .cmp files; this makes the -I option unnecessary for output
    formats besides HTML (#102, #108).

Version 1.1.0 (2016-04-02):
---------------------------
  - Port to 4.03.
  - Allow exclusion of entire files, instead of only top-level values (prompted
    @solongordon).
  - Allow files to be excluded by regular expression, instead of only by exact
    string match (requested @solongordon).

Version 1.0.1 (2016-03-04):
---------------------------
  - Add option -ignore-missing-files to bisect-ppx-report, which allows the
    reporter to silently ignore missing source files instead of failing. This is
    intended for build processes that generate temporary source files, but
    delete them before the reporter is run (requested Ivan Gotovchits).
  - Fix bug in which bisect-ppx-report treated source code as format strings for
    Buffer.add_substitute. This caused wrong behavior on source code substrings
    that looked like Buffer.add_substitute patterns (reported Ivan Gotovchits).
  - Various minor documentation and internal build fixes.

Version 1.0.0 (2016-02-09):
---------------------------
  - Redesign HTML reports.
  - Put separate points on each clause of or-patterns.
  - Put points on applications of |>.
  - Eliminate -safe, -fast, -faster modes. All modes now fast and thread-safe.
  - Improve integration with other ppx preprocessors.
  - Install native ppx rewriter when possible.
  - Adjust which points have which kinds.
  - Clean up command-line help of bisect-ppx-report.
  - Add Ocamlbuild plugin helper and "coverage" tag.
  - New documentation.
  - Testing, build, and packaging improvements.

Version 0.2.6 (2016-01-01):

---------------------------
  - Revert the _Random_ indices for output files, just create multiple
  - Correct dependency on Str in META.
  - Obey OCamls line directive when looking for BISECT comments.

Version 0.2.4 (2015-08-14):
---------------------------
  - Fast mode returns: create one array to track instrumented points per
    implementation file (module). Created a separate findlib package:
    bisect_ppx.fast to implement this method (just calls the ppx rewriter
    with the appropriate argument).
  - Runtime logging now default to a file: bisect.log. To regain original
    behavior set BISECT_SILENT=ERR. You can use the same variable to set
    a filename.
  - Fixed bug for creating html reports off of implicit filenames.

Version 0.2.3 (2015-06-17):
--------------------------
  - @hnrgrgr Fixed more comment lexing bugs
