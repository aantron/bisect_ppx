<a id="Usage"></a>
## Usage

<a id="Dune"></a>
### Dune

Refer to [**aantron/bisect-starter-dune**][dune-repo], which produces
[this report][dune-report].

1. [Depend on Bisect_ppx](https://github.com/aantron/bisect-starter-dune/blob/master/bisect-starter-dune.opam#L10)
   in your `opam` file:

    ```
    depends: [
      "bisect_ppx" {dev & >= "2.0.0"}
    ]
    ```

2. [Mark the code under test for preprocessing by
   `bisect_ppx`](https://github.com/aantron/bisect-starter-dune/blob/master/dune#L4) in your `dune` file:

    ```ocaml
    (* -*- tuareg -*- *)

    let preprocess =
      match Sys.getenv "BISECT_ENABLE" with
      | "yes" -> "(preprocess (pps bisect_ppx))"
      | _ -> ""
      | exception Not_found -> ""

    let () = Jbuild_plugin.V1.send @@ {|

    (library
     (public_name my_lib)
     |} ^ preprocess ^ {|)

    |}
    ```

    This uses Dune's
    [OCaml syntax](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced-topics.html#ocaml-syntax)
    to completely take `bisect_ppx` out as a dependency, except when the
    environment variable `BISECT_ENABLE` is set to `yes`. This is so that you
    can release your project without it depending on `bisect_ppx` for non-`dev`
    builds.

    After [ocaml/dune#57][dune-57], Dune will have a lighter-weight built-in
    syntax for conditional preprocessing.

    For now, the OCaml syntax can be understood as prepending a few lines of
    OCaml code to a regular `dune` file, and then replacing the `preprocess`
    stanza with `|} ^ preprocess ^ {|`. See
    [here](https://github.com/aantron/bisect-starter-dune/commit/24ffb2153d3c42ff166c78a9f55095bd12f10f4e#diff-cabdb1014252d39ac018f447e7d5fbc2)
    for a neat summary of the patch.

3. Build and run your test binary. In addition to testing your code, when
   exiting, it will write one or more files with names like
   `bisect0123456789.coverage`:

    ```
    BISECT_ENABLE=yes dune runtest --force
    ```

    The `--force` flag forces all your tests to run, which is needed for an
    accurate coverage report.

    To run tests without coverage, do

    ```
    dune runtest
    ```

4. Generate the [coverage report][dune-report] in `_coverage/index.html`:

    ```
    bisect-ppx-report html
    ```

    You can also generate a short summary in the terminal:

    ```
    bisect-ppx-report summary
    ```

<a id="esy"></a>
### esy

Refer to [**aantron/bisect-starter-esy**][esy-repo], which produces [this
report][esy-report].

The instructions are the same as for regular [Dune](#Dune) usage, but...

1. [Depend on Bisect_ppx in `package.json`](https://github.com/aantron/bisect-starter-esy/blob/master/package.json#L5),
instead of in an `opam` file:

    ```json
    "devDependencies": {
      "@opam/bisect_ppx": "^2.0.0",
    }
    ```

2. Use the `esy` command for the build and for running binaries:

    ```
    esy install
    BISECT_ENABLE=yes esy dune runtest --force
    esy dune exec bisect-ppx-report -- html
    ```

[esy-repo]: https://github.com/aantron/bisect-starter-esy
[esy-report]: https://aantron.github.io/bisect-starter-esy/



<br>

<a id="BuckleScript"></a>
### BuckleScript

Refer to [**aantron/bisect-starter-bsb**][bsb-repo], which produces
[this report][bsb-report].

1. [Depend on Bisect_ppx in `package.json`](https://github.com/aantron/bisect-starter-bsb/blob/master/package.json#L3-L6),
and install it:

    ```json
    "devDependencies": {
      "bisect_ppx": "^2.0.0"
    },
    "dependencies": {
      "bs-platform": "*"
    }
    ```

    ```
    npm install
    ```

    If you are using Yarn, you need to run an extra command because of
    [yarnpkg/pkg#3421](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/3421):

    ```
    yarn add bisect_ppx
    yarn --check-files
    ```

    If pre-built binaries aren't available for your system, the build will
    automatically fall back to building Bisect_ppx from source using
    [esy](https://esy.sh), which will take a few minutes the first time. If this
    happens, you may need to install esy, if it is not already installed:

    ```
    npm install -g esy
    npm install
    ```

2. [Add Bisect_ppx to your `bsconfig.json`](https://github.com/aantron/bisect-starter-bsb/blob/master/bsconfig.json#L3-L8):

    ```json
    "bs-dependencies": [
      "bisect_ppx"
    ],
    "ppx-flags": [
      "bisect_ppx/ppx"
    ]
    ```

3. If you are using Jest, add this to your `package.json`:

    ```json
    "setupFilesAfterEnv": ["bisect_ppx/lib/js/src/runtime/bucklescript/jest.js"]
    // or if you enable "package-specs.in-source" flag in bsconfig.json
    "setupFilesAfterEnv": ["bisect_ppx/src/runtime/bucklescript/jest.js"]
    ```

    If the tests will be running in the browser, at the end of testing, call

    ```reason
    Bisect.Runtime.get_coverage_data();
    ```

    This returns binary coverage data in a `string option`, which you should
    upload or otherwise get out of the browser, and write into a `.coverage`
    file.

4. Build in development with `BISECT_ENABLE=yes`, run tests, and generate the
[coverage report][bsb-report] in `_coverage/index.html`:

    ```
    BISECT_ENABLE=yes npm run build
    npm run test
    npx bisect-ppx-report.exe html
    ```

    To exclude your test files from the report, change your PPX flags like so:

    ```json
    "ppx-flags": [
      ["bisect_ppx/ppx", "--exclude-files", ".*test\\.re"]
    ]
    ```

    The last argument is a regular expression in the syntax of OCaml's [`Str`
    module](https://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Str.html). Note
    that backslashes need to be escaped both inside the regular expression, and
    again because they are inside a JSON string.

    Multiple `--exclude-files` option can be specified if you want to provide
    multiple patterns.

5. If your project uses both BuckleScript and native Dune, native Dune will
   start picking up OCaml files that are part of the BuckleScript `bisect_ppx`
   package. To prevent this, add a `dune` with the following contents to the
   root of your project:

   ```
   (data_only_dirs node_modules)
   ```

<a id="Js_of_ocaml"></a>
### Js_of_ocaml

Refer to [**aantron/bisect-starter-jsoo**][jsoo-repo], which produces
[this report][jsoo-report].

1. Follow the [Dune instructions](#Dune) above, except that [the final test
script must be linked with `bisect_ppx.runtime`](https://github.com/aantron/bisect-starter-jsoo/blob/master/dune#L9)
(but not instrumented):

    ```scheme
    (executable
     (name my_tester)
     (libraries bisect_ppx.runtime))
    ```

2. If the tests will run on Node, [call this function](https://github.com/aantron/bisect-starter-jsoo/blob/master/tester.ml#L3)
at the end of testing to write `bisect0123456789.coverage`:

    ```ocaml
    Bisect.Runtime.write_coverage_data ()
    ```

    If the tests will run in the browser, call

    ```ocaml
    Bisect.Runtime.get_coverage_data ()
    ```

    to get binary coverage data in a string option. Upload this string or
    otherwise extract it from the browser to create an `.coverage` file.

3. Build the usual Js_of_ocaml target, including the instrumented code under
test, then run the reporter to generate the [coverage report][jsoo-report] in
`_coverage/index.html`:

    ```
    BISECT_ENABLE=yes dune build my_tester.bc.js
    bisect-ppx-report html
    ```

[jsoo-repo]: https://github.com/aantron/bisect-starter-jsoo#readme
[jsoo-report]: https://aantron.github.io/bisect-starter-jsoo/



<br>

<a id="Ocamlbuild"></a>
### Ocamlfind, Ocamlbuild, and OASIS

- [Ocamlbuild](https://github.com/aantron/bisect_ppx-ocamlbuild#using-with-ocamlbuild)
and [OASIS](https://github.com/aantron/bisect_ppx-ocamlbuild#using-with-oasis)
instructions can be found at
[aantron/bisect_ppx-ocamlbuild](https://github.com/aantron/bisect_ppx-ocamlbuild#readme).

- With Ocamlfind, you must have your build script issue the right commands, to
instrument the code under test, but not the tester:

    ```
    ocamlfind opt -package bisect_ppx -c src/source.ml
    ocamlfind opt -c test/test.ml
    ocamlfind opt -linkpkg -package bisect_ppx src/source.cmx test/test.cmx
    ```

    Running the tester will then produce `bisect0123456789.coverage` files,
    which you can process with `bisect-ppx-report`.



<br>

<a id="Coveralls"></a>
## Sending to [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io)

`bisect-ppx-report` can send reports to Coveralls and Codecov directly from
Travis, CircleCI, and GitHub Actions. To do this, run

```
bisect-ppx-report send-to Coveralls
```

or

```
bisect-ppx-report send-to Codecov
```

When sending specifically from GitHub Actions to Coveralls, use

```
- run: bisect-ppx-report send-to Coveralls
  env:
    COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    PULL_REQUEST_NUMBER: ${{ github.event.number }}
```

Put these commands in your CI script in the same place you would run
`bisect-ppx-report html` locally. See
[bisect-ci-integration-megatest](https://github.com/aantron/bisect-ci-integration-megatest#readme)
for example CI scripts and current status of these integrations.

If you'd like Bisect_ppx to support other CI and/or coverage services, please
open an issue or send a pull request!

As a workaround for missing CI/coverage integrations, and for development,
`bisect-ppx-report` can also generate a JSON report in Coveralls format, which
can be uploaded to a service of your choice using a separate command. For
example, to send manually from Travis to Coveralls:

```
bisect-ppx-report \
  coveralls coverage.json \
  --service-name travis-ci \
  --service-job-id $TRAVIS_JOB_ID
curl -L -F json_file=@./coverage.json https://coveralls.io/api/v1/jobs
```

For other CI services, replace `--service-name` and `--service-job-id` as
follows:

| CI service | `--service-name` | `--service-job-id` |
| ---------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| Travis | `travis-ci` | `$TRAVIS_JOB_ID` |
| CircleCI | `circleci` | `$CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM` |
| Semaphore | `semaphore` | `$REVISION` |
| Jenkins | `jenkins` | `$BUILD_ID` |
| Codeship | `codeship` | `$CI_BUILD_NUMBER` |
| GitHub Actions | `github` | `$GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER` |

Note that Coveralls-style reports are less precise than the HTML reports
generated by Bisect_ppx, because Coveralls considers entire lines as visited or
not visited. Bisect_ppx instead considers individual expressions. There can be
many expressions on a single line, and the HTML report separately considers each
expression as visited or not visited.



<br>

<a id="Exclusion"></a>
## Controlling coverage with `[@coverage off]`

You can tag expressions with `[@coverage off]`, and neither they, nor their
subexpressions, will be instrumented by Bisect_ppx.

Likewise, you can tag module-level `let`-declarations with `[@@coverage off]`,
and they won't be instrumented.

You can also turn off instrumentation for blocks of declarations inside a
module with `[@@@coverage off]` and `[@@@coverage on]`.

Finally, you can exclude an entire file by putting `[@@@coverage exclude_file]`
into its top-level module. However, whenever possible, it is recommended to
exclude files by not preprocessing with Bisect_ppx to begin with.



<br>

<a id="Example"></a>
## Real-world example examined

Refer to:

- [**aantron/markup.ml**][markupml], which produces
[this local report][gh-pages-report], and
[this report on Coveralls][markupml-coveralls].
- The [Dune instructions](#Dune) and [Coveralls instructions](#Coveralls) above.

The details:

1. The project [depeds on package `bisect_ppx`](https://github.com/aantron/markup.ml/blob/33e40c49827fca4e10cc6a9c64a073f30d797f5b/markup.opam#L21),
so that Bisect_ppx is installed by `opam pin --dev-repo markup` and `opam install .`

2. There are three libraries in [`src/`](https://github.com/aantron/markup.ml/tree/33e40c49827fca4e10cc6a9c64a073f30d797f5b/src), each set to have its
sources preprocessed by Bisect_ppx:

    - [`markup`](https://github.com/aantron/markup.ml/blob/33e40c49827fca4e10cc6a9c64a073f30d797f5b/src/dune#L5)
    - [`markup-lwt`](https://github.com/aantron/markup.ml/blob/33e40c49827fca4e10cc6a9c64a073f30d797f5b/src/lwt/dune#L5)
    - [`markup-lwt.unix`](https://github.com/aantron/markup.ml/blob/33e40c49827fca4e10cc6a9c64a073f30d797f5b/src/lwt_unix/dune#L5)

    Because of the `--conditional` flag, preprocessing is enabled only when
    `BISECT_ENABLE=yes` is set in the environment, so it is off by default.

3. A coverage build is triggered by running [`make coverage`](https://github.com/aantron/markup.ml/blob/33e40c49827fca4e10cc6a9c64a073f30d797f5b/Makefile#L19-L25). This target...

    - Depends on `make clean`. This is a workaround until
    [ocaml/dune#57][dune-57] is solved. The problem is that doing a coverage
    build, after normal builds, should force all sources to be recompiled, so
    that they can be instrumented by the Bisect_ppx preprocessor. However, Dune
    doesn't know about this &mdash; it doesn't know that the behavior of the
    preprocessor depends on the `BISECT_ENABLE` environment variable.

        Indeed, the preprocessor shouldn't read this environment variable. The
        preprocessor should just be turned off by Dune when not building for
        coverage. However, Dune does not currently have the ability to
        conditionally turn off a preprocessor.

        In any case, to deal with this problem, the project always does a clean
        build when building for coverage.

    - Does a fresh build with `BISECT_ENABLE=yes`, causing the sources of the
    three libraries mentioned above to be instrumented.

    - Runs the test suite. `bisect*.coverage` files with coverage data are
    produced as a side effect.

    - Runs `bisect-ppx-report` to generate both the typical HTML report in
    `_coverage/index.html`, and also a textual summary in the terminal for very
    fast iteration.

4. `make coverage` is also [used in Travis](https://github.com/aantron/markup.ml/blob/33e40c49827fca4e10cc6a9c64a073f30d797f5b/.travis.yml#L33-L35)
to submit coverage reports to Coveralls. At the end of `make coverage`, the
`bisect*.coverage` files are still present, so `.travis.yml` runs
`bisect-ppx-report` again to generate the Coveralls report. This follows the
[Coveralls](#Coveralls) instructions exactly.

    Coveralls can be configured to [leave comments](https://github.com/aantron/markup.ml/pull/47#issuecomment-521707675)
    about changes in coverage. It is usually configured to at least add an
    additional check to branches and PRs &mdash; see the "3 checks passed" in
    the hidden Details of the [linked PR](https://github.com/aantron/markup.ml/pull/47).

5. During release, `(preprocess (pps bisect_ppx))` is [removed from all libraries that are being released](https://github.com/aantron/markup.ml/commit/ea68bebf5c3a19f56350393e359d444f864154e3#diff-d218652a79a651b9be8eee7641ea0893L5). This is typically in a one-commit release branch off master, which is what ends up being tagged.

    This won't be necessary after [ocaml/dune#57][dune-57] is addressed.

## Contributing

Bug reports and pull requests are warmly welcome. Bisect_ppx is developed on
GitHub, so please [open an issue][issues].

Bisect_ppx is developed mainly using opam. To get the latest development
version, run

```
opam source --dev-repo --pin bisect_ppx
```

You will now have a `bisect_ppx` subdirectory to work in. Try these `Makefile`
targets:

- `make test` for unit tests.
- `make usage` for build system integration tests, except BuckleScript.
- `make -C test/bucklescript full-test` for BuckleScript. This requires NPM and
  esy.
