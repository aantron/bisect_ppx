# Bisect_ppx &nbsp; [![version 1.3.4][version]][releases] [![Travis status][travis-img]][travis] [![Coverage][coveralls-img]][coveralls]

[Bisect_ppx][self] is a code coverage tool for OCaml. It helps you test
thoroughly by showing which parts of your code are **not** tested. You can also
use it for tracing: run one test, and see what is visited.

[![Bisect_ppx usage example][sample]][self-coverage]

For a live demonstration, see the [coverage report][self-coverage] Bisect_ppx
generates for itself. You may also want to see
[projects that use Bisect_ppx](#bisect_ppx-in-practice).

## Instructions

Most of these commands go in a `Makefile` or other script, so that you only have
to run that script, then refresh your browser.

1. Install Bisect_ppx.

        opam install bisect_ppx

   You can also install [without OPAM][without-opam].

2. When compiling for testing, include Bisect_ppx. Instructions are also
   available for [Dune][dune], [Ocamlbuild][ocamlbuild], and [OASIS][oasis].

        ocamlfind c -package bisect_ppx -c my_code.ml
        ocamlfind c -c my_tests.ml
        ocamlfind c -linkpkg -package bisect_ppx my_code.cmo my_tests.cmo

3. Run your test binary. In addition to testing your code, it will produce one
   or more files with names like `bisect0001.out`.

        ./a.out             # Produces bisect0001.out

4. Generate the coverage report.

        bisect-ppx-report -I _build/ -html coverage/ bisect*.out`

5. Open `coverage/index.html`!

    In each file of the report,

    - Green lines contain expressions, all of which were visited.
    - Red lines contain expressions, none of which were visited.
    - Yellow lines contain expressions, some of which were visited, but others not.
    - White lines are those that don't contain visitable expressions. They may have type declarations, keywords, or something else that Bisect_ppx did not, or cannot instrument.

See also the [advanced usage][advanced].

### Coveralls.io

(**New**) You can generate a Coveralls json report using the `bisect-ppx-report`
tool with the `-coveralls` flag.
Note that Bisect_ppx reports are more precise than Coveralls, which only
considers whole lines as visited or not. The built in Coveralls reporter will
consider a full line unvisited if any point on that line is not visited,
check the html report to verify precisly which points are not covered.

Example using the built in Coveralls reporter on Travis CI (which sets [`$TRAVIS_JOB_ID`][travis-vars]):

      bisect-ppx-report \
          -I _build/ \
          -coveralls coverage.json \
          -service-name travis-ci \
          -service-job-id $TRAVIS_JOB_ID \
          bisect*.out
      curl -L -F json_file=@./coverage.json https://coveralls.io/api/v1/jobs

## License

Bisect_ppx is available under the Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL). To
summarize, you can incorporate Bisect_ppx into proprietary projects. If you make
modifications to Bisect_ppx, you have to open-source them. The rest of your
project remains proprietary.

Essentially, this is like the BSD or MIT licenses, except that if you include
a customized Bisect_ppx in a release (as opposed to private use), you have to
make the altered source visible. This can be done by contributing the changes
back, keeping Bisect_ppx in a visible fork, or if your bigger project itself
also happens to be open source.

Besides proprietary licenses, MPL is compatible with BSD/MIT/Apache- and
(L)GPL-licensed projects. See the [MPL 2.0 FAQ][mpl-faq].
