; This is identical to the test in test/usage/js_of_ocaml, except that it links
; in the js_of_ocaml runtime library.  This changes the type of exception that's
; raised when attempting to write coverage data in Runtime.dump from Failure to
; Js.Error, since Failure is only used by caml_wrap_exception when Js.Error is
; not present.
