# TODO: Build a stand-alone compiler
  
  We need copy config.ml(i) lexer.ml(i) parser.ml(i) runtimedef.ml(i) from  ocaml 4.02.3
  distribution

  config.ml(i) are changed to dummy, since those configurations only
  make sense in C/ASM/Bytecode backend.

  The runtime should be rewritten to avoid using (String/Bytes) (since
  we modified it) any standard library.

  Since BuckleScript has different `cmi_format` from `4.02.3` due to
  external attributes, so `cmis` generated by `OCaml 4.02.3` is not ABI
  compatible with `cmis` generated by `BuckleScript`
