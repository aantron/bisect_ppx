  bsb will try to [check] if it is needed, 
  if needed, we will regenerate ninja file and store the 
  meta data again

   The data structure we decided to whether regenerate [build.ninja]

   ninja will not notice  its build spec changed, it will not trigger 
   rebuild behavior, is this a desired behavior not?

   It may not, since there is some subtlies here (__FILE__ or __dirname)
