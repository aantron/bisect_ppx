    It does several conversion:
    First, it will convert unix path to windows backward on windows platform.
    Then if it is absolute path, it will do thing
    Else if it is relative path, it will be rebased on project's root directory

   The difference between [convert_path] is that if the file is [ocamlc.opt] 
   it will not do any conversion to it (maybe environment variable will help it get picked up)

(* The path of [bsc] and [bsdep] is normalized so that the invokation of [./jscomp/bin/bsb.exe] 
   and [bsb.exe] (combined with a dirty bsconfig.json) will not trigger unnecessary rebuild.
   
   The location of [bsc] and [bsdep] is configured by the combination of [Sys.executable_name] 
   and [cwd].
   
   In theory, we should also check the integrity of [bsb.exe], if it is changed, the rebuild 
   should be regen, but that is too much in practice, not only you need check the integrity of 
   path of [bsb.exe] but also the timestamp, to make it 100% correct, also the integrity of 
   [bsdep.exe] [bsc.exe] etc.
