(** rules are generally composed of built-in rules and customized rules, there are two design choices:
    1. respect custom rules with the same name, then we need adjust our built-in 
    rules dynamically in case the conflict.
    2. respect our built-in rules, then we only need re-load custom rules for each bsconfig.json
*)


(** Since now we generate ninja files per bsconfig.json in a single process, 
    we must make sure it is re-entrant
