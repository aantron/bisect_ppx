(* DESIGN:  
    - It does not have any code, all its code will be inlined so that
       there will be never
       {[ require('js')]}
    - Its interface should be minimal
*)

(** This library provides bindings and necessary support for JS FFI. 
    It contains all bindings into [Js] namespace.

    @example {[
        [| 1;2;3;4|]
        |> Js.Array.map (fun x -> x + 1 )
        |> Js.Array.reduce (+) 0
        |> Js.log 
    ]}
*)

(* internal types for FFI, these types are not used by normal users *)

(** Types for JS objects *)

type +'a t
(** Js object type.  
   
    @example {[
        let x : < x : int ; y : int > Js.t =
            [%obj{ x = 1 ; y = 2}]
    ]}
 *)

type + 'a null
(** nullable, value of this type can be either [null] or ['a]
    this type is the same as type [t] in {!Null}    
*)

type + 'a undefined
(** value of this type can be either [undefined] or ['a]
    this type is the same as type [t] in {!Undefined}  *)

type + 'a null_undefined
(** value of this type can be [undefined], [null] or ['a]
    this type is the same as type [t] n {!Null_undefined} *)

type boolean
(** The value could be either  {!Js.true_} or {!Js.false_}.
     Note in BuckleScript, [boolean] has different representation from OCaml's [bool],
     see conversion functions in {!Boolean} *)

type (+'a, +'e) promise
(** The promise type, defined here for interoperation across packages 
    @deprecated please use {!Js.Promise}
*)


external true_ : boolean = "true" [@@bs.val]
external false_ : boolean = "false" [@@bs.val]

external null : 'a null = "" [@@bs.val] 
(** The same as [empty] in {!Js.Null} will be compiled as [null]*)

external undefined : 'a undefined = "" [@@bs.val] 
(** The same as  [empty] {!Js.Undefined} will be compiled as [undefined]*)


external to_bool : boolean -> bool = "#boolean_to_bool"
(** convert Js boolean to OCaml bool *)

external typeof : 'a -> string = "#typeof"
(** [typeof x] will be compiled as [typeof x] in JS 
    Please consider functions in {!Types} for a type safe way of reflection 
*)

external log : 'a -> unit = "log"

(** A convenience function to log everything *)

(** {4 operators }*)

external unsafe_lt : 'a -> 'a -> bool = "#unsafe_lt"
(** [unsafe_lt a b] will be compiled as [a < b].
    It is marked as unsafe, since it is impossible 
    to give a proper semantics for comparision which applies to any type
 *)
external unsafe_le : 'a -> 'a -> bool = "#unsafe_le"
(**  [unsafe_le a b] will be compiled as [a <= b].
