(* 
   Principle: since in ocaml, the apply order is not specified 
   rules:
   1. each argument it is only used once, (avoid eval duplication)
   2. it's actually used, if not (Lsequence)
   3. no nested  compuation, 
      other wise the evaluation order is tricky (make sure eval order is correct)
