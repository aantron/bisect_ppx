(** There is a side effect when traversing dead code, since

   [find_beg] can potentially be expanded in [find_end] and in [find_end]'s expansion, 
   if the order is not correct, or even worse, only the wrong one [find_beg] in [find_end] get expanded 
   (when we forget to recursive apply), then some code non-dead [find_beg] will be marked as dead,
