    A naive beta reduce would break the invariants of the optmization.


    The sane but slowest  way:
      when we do a beta reduction, we need rename all variables inlcuding 
      let-bound ones

    A conservative one:
      - for internal one 
        rename params and let bound variables
      - for external one (seriaized)
        if it's enclosed environment should be good enough
        so far, we only inline enclosed lambdas
    TODO: rename 

   Optimizations:   
   {[
     (fun x y -> ...     ) 100 3 
   ]}   
   we can bound [x] to [100] in a single step
