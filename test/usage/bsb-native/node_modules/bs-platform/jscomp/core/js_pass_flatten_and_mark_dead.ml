   when we do optmizations, we might need track it will break invariant 
   of other optimizations, especially for [mutable] meta data, 
   for example, this pass will break [closure] information, 
   it should be done before closure pass (even it does not use closure information)

   Take away, it is really hard to change the code while collecting some information..
   we should always collect info in a single pass

   Note that, we should avoid reuse object, i.e,
   {[

       object 
       end
