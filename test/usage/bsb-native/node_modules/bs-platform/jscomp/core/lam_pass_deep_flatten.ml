      (** be careful to flatten letrec 
          like below : 
          {[
            let rec even = 
              let odd n =  if n ==1 then true else even (n - 1) in
              fun n -> if n ==0  then true else odd (n - 1)
          ]}
          odd and even are recursive values, since all definitions inside 
          e.g, [odd] can see [even] now, however, it should be fine
          in our case? since ocaml's recursive value does not allow immediate 
          access its value direclty?, seems no
          {[
            let rec even2 = 
              let odd = even2 in
              fun n -> if n ==0  then true else odd (n - 1)
          ]}
      *)
      (* FIXME:
          here we try to move inner definitions of [recurisve value] upwards
          for example:
         {[
           let rec x = 
             let y = 32 in
             y :: x
           and z = ..
             ---
             le ty = 32 in
           let rec x = y::x
           and z = ..
         ]}
          however, the inner definitions can see [z] and [x], so we
          can not blindly move it in the beginning, however, for 
          recursive value, ocaml does not allow immediate access to 
          recursive value, so what's the best strategy?
