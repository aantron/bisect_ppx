    1. We don't want to force user to have 
       [-bs-package-name] and [-bs-package-output] set

       [bsc.exe -c hello.ml] should just work 
       by producing a [hello.js] file in the same directory

    Some designs due to legacy reasons that we don't have all runtime
    written in OCaml, so it might only have js files (no cmjs) for Runtime kind
