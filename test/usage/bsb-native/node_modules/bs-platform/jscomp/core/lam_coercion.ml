(*
  Invariant: The last one is always [exports]
  Compile definitions
  Compile exports
  Assume Pmakeblock(_,_),
  lambda_exports are pure
  compile each binding with a return value

  Such invariant  might be wrong in toplevel (since it is all bindings)

  We should add this check as early as possible

(*           
- {[ Ident.same id eid]} is more  correct, 
        however, it will introduce a coercion, which is not necessary, 
        as long as its name is the same, we want to avoid 
        another coercion                
        In most common cases, it will be 
   {[
     let export/100 =a fun ..
         export/100    
   ]}
        This comes from we have lambda as below 
   {[
     (* let export/100 =a export/99  *)
     (* above is probably the cause but does not have to be  *)
     (export/99)                
   ]}
        [export/100] was not eliminated due to that it is export id, 
        if we rename export/99 to be export id, then we don't need 
        the  coercion any more, and export/100 will be dced later
   - avoid rebound
   check [map.ml] here coercion, we introduced 
                    rebound which is not corrrect 
   {[
     let Make/identifier = function (funarg){
         var $$let = Make/identifier(funarg);
                 return [0, ..... ]
       }
   ]}
                    Possible fix ? 
                    change export identifier, we should do this in the very 
                    beginning since lots of optimizations depend on this
                    however
