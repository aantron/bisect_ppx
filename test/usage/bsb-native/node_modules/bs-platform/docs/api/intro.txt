{1 Libraries shipped with BuckleScript}

BuckleScript is mostly a compiler, but it does ship some libraries for users' convenience

{2 4 libraries}

{!Js} 

This library are mostly bindings to JS, it should work with both NodeJS and Browser.
It is strongly recommended to use qualified name instead of flatten module name. 
For example
{[
    [| 1; 2 ; 3 |] 
    |> Js.Array.map (fun x -> x + 1 )
    |> Js.log 
]}

{!Node}

This library contains bindings to NodeJS, it is still work in progress, use it with care, 
and we may break API backward compatiblity in the future.

{!Dom}

This library are for DOM API, currently it only defines some 
types for diferent packages to talk to each other

{!Bs}

This namespace is reserved for providing some utilities in the future

BuckleScript also shipped the vanilla OCaml standard library.
