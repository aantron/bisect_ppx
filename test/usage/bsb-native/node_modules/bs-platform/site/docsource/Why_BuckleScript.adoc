## Why BuckleScript

### Benefits of JavaScript platform

JavaScript is not just _the_ browser language, it's also the _only_
existing cross platform language. It is truly everywhere: users don't
need to install binaries or use package managers to access software,
just a link will work.

Another important factor is that the JavaScript VM is quite fast and
keeps getting faster. The JavaScript platform is therefore
increasingly capable of supporting large applications.

### Problems of JavaScript && how BuckleScript solves them

BuckleScript is mainly designed to solve the problems of _large scale_ JavaScript programming:

Type-safety:: OCaml offers an industrial-strength
   state-of-the-art type system and provides very strong type inference (i.e. No
   verbose type annotation required compared with TypeScript), which proves
   http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/215482/what-are-the-safety-benefits-of-a-type-system[invaluable]
   in managing large projects. OCaml's type system is not just for tooling,
   it is a _sound_ type system which means it is guaranteed that there will
   be no runtime type errors after type checking.

High quality dead code elimination::
 A large amount of web-development relies on inclusion of
   code dependencies by copying or referencing CDNs (the very thing
   that makes JavaScript highly accessible), but this also introduces
   a lot of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_code[dead code]. This
   impacts performance adversely when the JavaScript VM has to
   interpret code that will never be invoked. BuckleScript provides
   powerful dead-code elimination at all levels:

      - Function and module level elimination is facilitated by the
      sophistication of the type-system of OCaml and _purity analysis_.
      - At the global level BuckleScript generates code ready for
      dead-code elimination done by bundling tools such as the
      {closure}[Google closure-compiler].

Offline optimizations:: JavaScript is a dynamic language, it
   takes a performance-hit for the VM to optimize code at runtime.
   While some JS engines circumvent the problem to some extent by
   http://v8project.blogspot.com/2015/07/code-caching.html[caching],
   this is not available to all environments, and lack of a strong
   type system also limits the level of optimizations possible. Again,
   BuckleScript, using features of the OCaml type-system and compiler
   implementation is able to provide many optimizations during offline
   compilation, allowing the runtime code to be extremely fast.

JS platform and Native platform::
  Run your programs on all platforms, but run your system _faster_
  under specific platforms. JavaScript is everywhere but it does not
  mean we have to run all apps in JS, under several platforms, for
  example, server side or iOS/Android native apps, when programs are
  written in OCaml, it can also be compiled to native code for _better
  and reliable performance_.

While a strong type-system helps in countering these problems, at the
same time we hope to avoid some of the problems faced in using other
offline {transpile-list}[transpilation systems]:

Slow compilation:: OCaml byte-code compilation is known to be fast
  (one or two orders of magnitude faster than other similar languages:
http://www.scala-lang.org/[Scala] or
  https://www.haskell.org/[Haskell]),
  BuckleScript shares the same property and compiles even faster
  since it saves the link time. See the speeds at work in the
  {BuckleScript-playground}[playground], the native backend is one
  order faster than the JS backend.

Un-readable JS Code and hard to integrate with existing JS libraries::
When compiling to JavaScript, many systems
  generate code, that while syntactically and semantically correct is
  not human-readable and very difficult to debug and profile.
  Our BuckleScript implementation and the multi-pass compilation strategy of OCaml,
  allows us to avoid {name-mangling}[name-mangling],
  and produce JavaScript code that is human-readable and easier to debug and
  maintain. More importantly, this makes integration with existing JS
  libraries _much easier_.

Large JS output even for a simple program::
In BuckleScript, a `Hello world` program generates _20 bytes_ JS code
instead of _50K bytes_. This is due to BuckleScript having an excellent
integration with JS libs in that unlike most JS compilers,
all BuckleScript's runtime is written in OCaml itself so that these
runtime libraries are only needed when user actually calls it.



Loss of code-structure::
 Many systems generate JavaScript code that is essentially a
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_ball_of_mud[big ball of mud]. We try
  to keep the original structure of the code by mapping one OCaml module
  to one JS module.
