## Comparisons

### Difference from https://github.com/ocsigen/js_of_ocaml[js_of_ocaml]

Js_of_ocaml is a popular compiler which compiles OCaml's bytecode into JavaScript. It is the
inspiration for this project, and has already been under development for
several years and is ready for production. In comparison, BuckleScript,
while moving fast, is still a very young project. BuckleScript's
motivation, like `js_of_ocaml`, is to unify the ubiquity of the
JavaScript platform and the truly sophisticated type system of OCaml,
however, there are some areas where we view things differently from
`js_of_ocaml`. We describe below, some of these differences, and also
refer readers to some of the original informal
https://github.com/ocsigen/js_of_ocaml/issues/338[discussions].

* Js_of_ocaml takes low-level bytecode from OCaml compiler, BuckleScript
takes the high-level rawlambda representation from OCaml compiler
* Js_of_ocaml focuses more on existing OCaml ecosystem(opam) while
BuckleScript's major goal is to target npm
* Js_of_ocaml and BuckleScript have slightly different runtime encoding
in several places, for example, BuckleScript encodes OCaml Array as JS
Array while js_of_ocaml requires its index 0 to be of value 0.

Both projects are improving quickly, so this can change in the future!
