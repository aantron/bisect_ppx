There are two Playgrounds, one for
https:////bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript-playground[vanilla OCaml],
the other for
https:////bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/reason-demo[Facebook Reason]

Note that the playgrounds are only for demos and might not be the
latest.
You should always use the command line as your production tool.
