== Build system support

The BuckleScript compilation model is similar to OCaml native compiler.
If `b.ml` depends on `a.ml`, you have to compile `a.ml` *and* `a.mli`
first.


[NOTE]
======
The technical reason is that BuckleScript will generate intermediate
files with the extension `.cmj` which are later used for cross module
inlining, arity inference and other information.
======

=== BuckleScript build system: `bsb`

BuckleScript provides a native build tool on top of Google's https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases[ninja-build].
It is designed for a fast feedback loop (typically 100ms feedback loop) and works cross platform.

// [INFO]
// ======
// Currently for non-Windows users, they need to install ninja first (version >= 1.7.1).
// Please don't be confused with the npm ninja,
// we are using Google's https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases[ninja-build].
// ======

`bsb` can be running in any subdirectory. It is a schema based build tool and the schema is
http://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/docson/#build-schema.json[available]. It is strongly recommended to **check out the http://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/docson/#build-schema.json[schema]**
after you finish reading the tutorials below.

If your editor supports JSON schema validation and auto-completion like https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json[VSCode],
below is a configuration to help you get auto-completion and validation for free:

.settings.json
[source,js]
------------
{
    "json.schemas": [
        {
            "fileMatch": [
                "bsconfig.json"
            ],
            "url" : "file:///path/to/bucklescript/docs/docson/build-schema.json" // <1>
        }
    ],
    // ....
}
------------

The build system is installed as `bsb.exe` in `bs-platform/bin/bsb.exe`. Due to a known issue in npm,
we create a JS wrapper (which is accessible in `.bin` too) so the user can call
either `bsb` (slightly higher latency but symlinked into `.bin`) or `bsb.exe`


Here is a *minimal* configuration:

.bsconfig.json
[source,js]
-----------
{
  "name": "test", // package name, required <1>
  "sources": "src" // <2>
}
-----------
<1> It is an extension to JSON with comment support
<2> Here we did not list files, so all `.ml`, `.mli`, `.re`, `.rei` will be considered as source files


The entry point is `bsb`.
It will check if there is already `build.ninja` in the build directory,
and if not or it needs to be regenerated it will generate the file `build.ninja`
and delegate the hard work to `ninja`.


The directory layout (after building) would be

-----------
.
├── lib
│   ├── bs
│   │   ├── src
│   │   └── test
│   ├── js
│   │   ├── src
│   │   └── test
│   ├── amdjs // <1>
│   │   ├── src
│   │   └── test
│   ├── goog  // <2>
│   │   ├── src
│   │   └── test
│   └── ocaml
├── scripts
├── src
└── test
-----------
<1> Will generate amdjs modules if flags are turned on
<2> Will generate goog modules if flags are turned on

We wrap `bsb.exe` as `bsb` so that it will work across different platforms.

.Watch mode
[source,sh]
--------------------
bsb // <1>
bsb -w // <2>
--------------------
<1> Do the plain build
<2> Do the plain build and watch




==== Build with other BuckleScript dependencies

List your dependency in `bs-dependencies` and install it via `npm install` as below:

.bsconfig.json
[source,js]
-----------
{
    "name": "bs-string",
    "version": "0.1.3",
    "bs-dependencies": [
        "bs-mocha" // <1>
    ],
    "sources": [
       .. .
    ],
    "generate-merlin" : false // <2>
}
-----------
<1> Yet another BuckleScript dependency
<2> If true (default) bsb will generate merlin file for you

.package.json
[source,js]
-----------
{
 "dependencies": {
    "bs-mocha": "0.1.5"
    },
  ...
}
-----------

After your `npm install`,
[source,sh]
----------
bsb -clean-world // <1>
bsb -make-world // <2>
bsb -w // <3>
----------
<1> Clean the binary artifact of current build and your dependency
<2> Build dependencies and lib itself
<3> Start watching the project and whenever your changes are made, `bsb` will rebuild incrementally

You can also streamline the three commands as below:

[source,sh]
-----------
bsb -clean-world -make-world -w
-----------

==== Mark your directory as dev only


Note sometimes, you have directories which are just tests that you don't need your dependency
to build. In that case you can mark it as dev only:

.bsconfig.json
[source,js]
-----------
{
        "sources" : {
                "dir" : "test",
                "type" : "dev" // <1>
        }
}
-----------
<1> directory `test` is in dev mode, it will not be built when used as a dependency


=== A real world example of using `bsb`

Below is a json configuration for the https://github.com/OvermindDL1/bucklescript-tea[bucklescript-tea]: the Elm artchitecture in BuckleScript

.bsconfig.json
[source,js]
-----------
{
  "name": "bucklescript-tea",
  "version": "0.1.3",
  "sources": [
   "src", // <1>
    {
      "dir": "test",
      "type": "dev" // <2>
    }
  ]
}
-----------
<1> Source directory, by default it will export all units of this directory to users.
<2> Dev directory, which will only be useful for developers of this project.

.package.json
[source,js]
-----------
{
  "name": "bucklescript-tea",
  "version": "0.1.3",
  "description": "TEA for Bucklescript",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "bsb",
    "watch": "bsb -w",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "peerDependencies": {
    "bs-platform": "^1.7.0" // <1>
  }
}
-----------
<1> Here we list `bs-platform` as a peer dependency so that different repos shares the same compiler.

Now, we have a repo https://github.com/bobzhang/bucklescript-have-tea[bucklescript-have-tea] to depend on `bucklescript-tea`, its configurations are as below:

.bsconfig.json
[source,js]
-----------
{
    "name" : "bucklescript-have-tea",
    "sources" : "src",
    "bs-dependencies": [
      "bucklescript-tea"
    ]
}
-----------


.package.json
[source,js]
-----------
{
    "name" : "bucklescript-have-tea",
    "version" : "0.1.0",
    "dependencies" : { "bucklescript-tea" : "^0.1.2" }, // <1>
    "peerDependencies" : { "bs-platform" : "^1.7.0" } //<2>
}
-----------
<1> List `bucklescript-tea` as dependency
<2> List `bs-platform` as peer dependency

Suppose you are in `bucklescript-have-tea` top directory,

[source,sh]
----------
npm install // <1>
npm install bs-platform <2>
./node_modules/.bin/bsb -clean-world -make-world -w <3>
----------
<1> Install the dependencies
<2> Install peer dependencies
<3> On Windows, it would be `.\node_modules\.bin\bsb -clean-world -make-world -w`


You can also change the `package-specs` to have another module format, for example, tweak your `bsconfig.json`:
[source,js]
----------
{
  ... ,
  "package-specs" : ["amdjs", "commonjs"],
  ...
}
----------

Rerun the command

[source,sh]
----------
bsb -clean-world -make-world
----------

You will get both `commonjs` and `amdjs` support. In the end, we suggest you http://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/docson/#build-schema.json[check out the schema] and enjoy the build!



=== Build using Make
[WARNING]
========
`bsb` is the officially recommended build system. This section is included here only for people who
are _curious_ about how the build works.
========

BuckleScript distribution has `bsdep.exe` which has the same interface as `ocamldep`

Here is a simple Makefile to get started:

.Makefile
[source,make]
-------------
OCAMLC=bsc.exe # <1>
OCAMLDEP=bsdep.exe # <2>
SOURCE_LIST := src_a src_b
SOURCE_MLI = $(addsuffix .mli, $(SOURCE_LIST))
SOURCE_ML  = $(addsuffix .ml, $(SOURCE_LIST))
TARGETS := $(addsuffix .cmj, $(SOURCE_LIST))
INCLUDES=
all: $(TARGETS)
.mli:.cmi
        $(OCAMLC) $(INCLUDES) $(COMPFLAGS) -c $<
.ml:.cmj:
        $(OCAMLC) $(INCLUDES) $(COMPFLAGS) -c $<
-include .depend
depend:
        $(OCAMLDEP) $(INCLUDES) $(SOURCE_ML) $(SOURCE_MLI) > .depend
-------------
<1> bsc.exe is the BuckleScript compiler
<2> ocamldep executable is part of the OCaml compiler installation

In theory, people need run `make depend && make all`. `make depend` will calculate dependencies
while `make all` will do the job.

However in practice, people used to a file watch service,
such as https://facebook.github.io/watchman/[watchman] for example, will need the JSON configuration:

.build.json
[source,json]
-------------
[
    "trigger", ".", {
        "name": "build",
        "expression": ["pcre", "(\\.(ml|mll|mly|mli|sh|sh)$|Makefile)"], // <1>
        "command": ["./build.sh"],
        "append_files" : true
    }
]
-------------
<1> whenever such files changed, it will trigger `command` field to be run

.build.sh
[source,sh]
-----------
make -r -j8 all <1>
make depend // <2>
-----------
<1> build
<2> update the dependency


Now in your working directory, type `watchman -j < build.json` and enjoy the lightning build speed.

=== Customize rules (generators support, @since 1.7.4) 

It is quite common that programmers use some pre-processors to generate some bolierpolate code during developement.

Note pre-processors can be classified as two categories, one is system-dependent which should be delayed until running on user machines, the other is system-indepdent , lex, yacc, m4, re2c, etc, which could be executed anytime.

BuckleScript has built in support for conditional compilation, this section is about the second part, since it is system-indepdent, we ask users to always generate such code and check in before shipping, this would help cut the dependencies for end users.

A typical example would be like this

.Bsb using ocamlyacc
[source,js]
-----------
{
    "generators" : [
        { "name" : "ocamlyacc" ,
          "command" : "ocamlyacc $in" }
    ],    
    ...,
    "sources" : {
        "dir" : "src",
        "generators" : [
            {
                "name" : "ocamlyacc",
                "edge" : ["test.ml", "test.mli", ":", "test.mly"]
            }
        ]
    }
}
-----------


Note `ocamlyacc` will generate in `test.ml` and `test.mli` in the same directory with `test.mly`, user should check in generated file since then users would not need run  ocamlyacc again, this would apply to `menhir` as well.

When users are developing current project, `bsb` will track the dependencies between `test.ml` and `test.mly` properly, when released 
as  a package, `bsb` will cut such dependency, so that users will 
only need the generated `test.ml`, to help test such behavior in development mode, users could set it manually

[source,js]
-----------
{
    ...,
    "cut-generators" : true
}
-----------

Then `bsb` will not re-generate `test.ml` whenever `test.mly` changes.
