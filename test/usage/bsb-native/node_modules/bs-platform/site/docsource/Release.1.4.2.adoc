BuckleScript 1.4.2 release comes with quite a few enhancement.

Most notable features:

1. The build system is ready to handle multiple npm packages, and its module system can be
overriden by the end user. For example, if the library A(end user) depends library B and library C,
we only need tell the build system that A needs goog module system, then B, C will be built using
goog module system too.

There are quite lots of enhancements to the build system, we strongly recommend users to re-read
the documentation http://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/Manual.html#_build_system_support

2. FFI add a new feature: http://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/Manual.html#_fixed_arguments

3. FFI can handle `bs.obj` and `bs.string` combination:
