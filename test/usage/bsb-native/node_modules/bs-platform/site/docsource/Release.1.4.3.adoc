Besides a number of minor bug fixes, most notable changes

# ES6 module support, "es6", "es6-global" , "amdjs-global"

"es6" package-spec will generate es6 modules for each ocaml module,
"es6-global" will also generate es6 modules but the path does not rely on node
module resolution
"amdjs-globa" is similar to "es6-global"

The es6 module is in perfect combination with rollup as a bundler, see this link
