val register_file :

  string -> point_count:int -> point_definitions:string ->
    [`Staged of (int -> unit)]
(** [register_file file ~point_count ~point_definitions] indicates that the file
    [file] is part of the application that has been instrumented.
    [point_definitions] is a serialized [Common.point_definition list] giving
    the locations of all points in the file. The returned callback is used to
    increment visitation counts. *)

val get_coverage_data : unit -> string option
(** Returns the binary coverage data accumulated by the program so far. This
    should eventually be written to a file, to be processed by
    [bisect-ppx-report]. *)

val write_coverage_data : unit -> unit
(** On Node.js, writes the same coverage data that is returned by
    {!get_coverage_data} to a [.coverage] file with a randomized name in the
    current directory. *)

val write_coverage_data_on_exit : unit -> unit
(** Registers {!write_coverage_data} to be called automatically on process
    exit. *)
