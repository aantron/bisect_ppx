(* Simulate the old behavior for current ocveralls. This is quite fragile,
   because it depends on two things:
   - read_points is only called after all .out files are read with
     read_runtime_data.
   - There are no duplicate source file names anywhere in the project. This is
     necessary because read_runtime_data finds unprefixed source file names,
     while read_points receives file names with the -I option already
     applied. *)
