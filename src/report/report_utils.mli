(** This module defines utility functions for the report program. *)



module Infix :
sig
  val (+|) : int array -> int array -> int array
  (** Returns the sum of the passed arrays, using saturation arithmetic to sum
      elements. The length of the returned array is the maximum of the lengths
      of the passed arrays, missing elements from the smallest array being
      supposed to be equal to [0]. *)
end

val mkdirs : ?perm:Unix.file_perm -> string -> unit
(** Creates the directory whose path is passed, and all necessary parent
    directories. The optional [perms] parameter indicates the permissions
    used for directory creation(s), defaulting to [0o755].

    Raises [Unix.Unix_error] if creation fails. *)

val split : ('a -> bool) -> ('a list) -> 'a list * 'a list
(** [split p [e1; ...; en]] returns [([e1; ...; e(i-1)], [ei; ...; en])]
    where [i] is the lowest index such that [p ei] evaluates to false. *)

val open_both : string -> string -> in_channel * out_channel
(** [open_both in_file out_file] return a [(i, o)] couple where:
    - [i] is an input channel for [in_file];
    - [o] is an output channel for [out_file].

    Raises an exception if an error occurs; ensures that files are either
    both opened or both closed. *)

val output_strings :
  string list -> (string * string) list -> out_channel -> unit
(** [output_strings lines mapping ch] writes the elements of [lines]
    to the channel [ch]. Each line is written after substituting
    {i $(xyz)} sequences as described by [Buffer.add_substitute]. The
    substitution is based on the association list [mapping]; if no mapping
    is found, [""] is used.

    Raises an exception if an error occurs. *)

(** Types and functions related to visitation counts.
    All operations gracefully handle overflows by ensuring that:
    - a value above [max_int] is encoded by [max_int];
    - a value below [min_int] is encoded by [min_int]. *)

type counts = {
    mutable visited : int; (** Number of points actually visited. *)
    mutable total : int (** Total number of points. *)
  }
(** The type of visitation count statistics. These are used for each file, and
    for the whole project. *)

val make : unit -> counts
(** Evaluates to [{visited = 0; total = 0}]. *)

val update : counts -> bool -> unit
(** [update counts v] updates [counts]. [counts.total] is always incremented,
    while [counts.visited] is incremented iff [v] equals [true]. *)

val add : counts -> counts -> counts
(** [add x y] returns the sum of counts [x] and [y]. *)

val read_points : string -> Bisect_common.point_definition list
(** [read_points s] reads point definitions from the string [s]. *)

val line_counts :
  (string -> unit) ->
  'a -> string ->
  int array ->
  ('a, string) Hashtbl.t -> int option list
(** [line_counts verbose in_file resolved_in_file visited points] computes the
    visited lines for [in_file]. *)
